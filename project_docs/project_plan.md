## Day 1
  [] User story (HL) 
  [] Wireframe (Mays )
  [] app flow (AJ)
    * user experience 
      - user visiting page -> browsing for dishes based on category -> selecting of items -> add / remove -> placing order -> form phone # + name submit + credit infomation -> confirmation on screen -> SMS both client and resturant 
    
    * resutrant experience 
      - recieves SMS notificaiton for order -> wbesite updates with new orders (render tweets on new tweet) -> specify time to fulfill (default || override) ->  
        order is ready -> mark complete -> app sends SMS to notify customer 

        similar to tweeter behaviour for the resturant
        owner can see the order in a tweet like container 
        submit  tweet => submit order => update dB and render the "tweets" (order)

      - new order goes to the bottom of the list (.append)
      - once order is complete, it pops off the order list

  [] ERD 
      - menu_dishes

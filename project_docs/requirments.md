- select one or more dishes and place them in a cart

- checkout and place an order for pick up

## app specific
- restaurant can specify how long it will take to fulfill  the order
- order once placed, need to collect client basic info / name + phone number
 
## database

  name
  photo
  brief description
  price
  default estimated time || user

## API
